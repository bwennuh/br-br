              <p>Hi! I'm Brenna :)</p>

              <p>I am a short, blonde vegan who lives for ice cream üç¶ and Lightning McQueen ‚ö°</p>

              <p>When I‚Äôm not rewatching the Cars movie for the umpteenth time, I am a Software Engineer who strives to bring creativity into anything and everything I do.</p>

              <p>I started out in Mechanical Engineering with the intent to design roller coasters üé¢, but my motion sickness had other plans. Ultimately, I made the switch to Software Engineering to continue to help fuel my passions for innovative design, figuring out how things work and finding efficient solutions for everyday problems.</p>
